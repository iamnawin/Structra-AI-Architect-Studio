# ArchAI: AI-Powered Home Design & Architecture

ArchAI is a next-generation platform that democratizes architectural design. It allows homeowners and developers to transform abstract requirements or rough blueprints into professional-grade 2D plans, 3D renders, and immersive VR experiences using advanced AI orchestration.

## User Flow

1.  **Intake Wizard**: User enters plot size, room requirements, budget, style preferences (e.g., Modern, Brutalist, Traditional), and optional constraints (e.g., Vastu compliance).
2.  **Blueprint Upload (Optional)**: User uploads an existing sketch or technical drawing (PDF/JPG/PNG).
3.  **AI Analysis**: The system parses the blueprint (if provided) or generates a spatial layout from scratch.
4.  **Concept Generation**: The system produces 3 distinct concept options with layout variations and stylistic mood boards.
5.  **Refinement & Iteration**: User selects a concept and iterates via natural language (e.g., "Make the master bedroom larger", "Add a balcony to the north").
6.  **High-Fidelity Output**: Once finalized, the system generates:
    *   **2D Plan Set**: Scaled floor plans and elevations.
    *   **3D Renders**: Photorealistic interior and exterior images.
    *   **VR Walkthrough**: A 360-degree panorama or a WebXR-enabled 3D model.
7.  **Export**: Downloadable PDF plan sets, Bill of Quantities (BOQ) estimates, and 3D models (glTF/OBJ).

## Key Features

*   **Vastu-Aware Design**: Optional integration for Indian architectural principles.
*   **Progressive Rendering**: Immediate low-fidelity previews that refine into high-fidelity assets.
*   **Version Control**: Every iteration is saved, allowing users to jump back to previous design states.
*   **Cost Estimation**: Real-time BOQ updates based on design changes and material selection.
