Structra AI: The Future of Architectural DesignDesign Your Home. See It Come Alive.

Structra AI is a cutting-edge, AI-native platform for architectural design. It seamlessly transforms initial concepts, room measurements, or existing blueprints into functional, intelligent floor plans, stunning 3D models, and fully immersive spatial experiences.

It replaces the complexity of traditional CAD software with a simple, guided, and conversational design process, powered by advanced artificial intelligence and real-time visualization technology. Structra is built for the next generation of home planning.-----Why Choose Structra AI?

Home design today is often technical, fragmented, and slow. Structra AI redefines this process by providing a unified, intelligent workflow where users can:
Describe their vision using everyday language.
Upload and analyze an existing floor plan.
Instasesntly generate and explore optimized layout options.
Visualize spaces in photorealistic 3D.
Virtually walk through their future home.

-----Intuitive User Experience Flow

Structra AI offers three simple entry points to begin designing:
1️⃣ Blueprint Path: For users with an existing plan.
Flow: Upload → Analyze → Confirm → Generate
2️⃣ Measurement Path: For users with basic plot size and requirements.
Flow: Answer (Questions) → Synthesize → Visualize
3️⃣ Idea Path: For early-stage exploration and dreamers.
Flow: Describe → Discover → Design
-----System and Technology🏛️ Modular Architecture

Structra AI utilizes a modular, multi-agent pipeline for robust and scalable performance:

User Input → Architect AI (Intent) → Blueprint AI (Plan Understanding) → Design AI (Layout Synthesis) → 3D Model Builder → Render & VR Pipeline → Export & Sharing🧱 Technology Stack
Frontend: Next.js / React, Tailwind CSS, Three.js (for 3D), WebXR (planned).
Backend: Node.js / NestJS, REST/GraphQL APIs, Python geometry services (optional).
AI Layer: LLM orchestration (OpenAI / Claude), Vision models (for parsing), Constraint-based layout engine.
Data & Infrastructure: PostgreSQL, Redis, Object storage (S3/R2), Worker queue (BullMQ / Celery).
