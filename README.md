# Structra AI: The Future of Architectural Design

Structra AI is an advanced architectural design studio powered by a collaborative team of AI agents. From blueprint analysis to immersive VR walkthroughs, Structra AI streamlines the entire design process.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized AI agents (Architect, Design, 3D, Render) work together to bring your vision to life.
- **Blueprint Analysis**: Upload existing blueprints (JPG/PNG/PDF) for instant spatial analysis and 2D reconstruction.
- **Instant 3D Modeling**: Convert 2D concepts into spatial 3D volumes with a single click.
- **Photorealistic Renders**: Generate high-fidelity interior and exterior renders using advanced image generation models.
- **VR Walkthroughs**: Experience your designs in immersive 1:1 scale before a single brick is laid.
- **Intelligent Design Iteration**: Chat with the Architect AI to refine requirements, styles, and spatial distributions.

## 📋 Repository Status
